Version 1 of the Arduino fan controller
The communication protocol is largely finished and currently exists in a working state. Although the Arduino's code should be objectized (turned into cpp code),
it works fine as it is now.

Version log:
    [~] Impliment a packaging system that can reliably receive data without receiving wrong data due to comm noise
    -[X] Recognize packet headers
    -[ ] Timeout unfinished packets
    -[ ] Do packet checksumming
    -[X] Do packet specific sanity checking
    -[ ] Send packet specific (addressed) ACKs to the host on successful receipt of packet
  ->[ ] Decrease power usage between serial data and PWM pulses by utilizing the Atmel sleep function
  ->[ ] Impliment the communication timeout failsafe. After 2 minutes of no comms, the Atmel should set all fans to highest velocity.
    [X] Set fans to values recieved via serial from host
    [ ] Enable onboard PID controlling
    -[ ] Create commands that allow for PID settings to be setup from host
    -[ ] Save the received PID values in EEPROM and read on boot
